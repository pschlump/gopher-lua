/*
** runtime/rt_abi.h — the frozen ABI between the Lua→wasm backend's
** emitted code and the C runtime (design doc §4.4, §5; M3).
**
** Architecture (proven by wasm/sharedmem_test.go):
**   - ONE linear memory: the script module imports the runtime module's
**     exported memory. All pointers below are i32 addresses in that
**     shared space; TValues written by either side are visible to both.
**   - Downward calls only: emitted code calls rt_*. The runtime NEVER
**     calls into script code. When the runtime must run Lua (function
**     metamethods, sort comparators, pcall of compiled functions) it
**     interprets the proto through its own lvm copy — script protos are
**     real Proto structs in shared memory. Correctness therefore never
**     depends on the compiled path; compiled code is pure acceleration.
**   - Values: a "cell" is a real Lua TValue (lobject.h). On wasm32
**     sizeof(TValue)==16 (8-byte union + tt + padding) — enforced by
**     static asserts in rt_abi.c. The tag constants below are frozen
**     (they are Lua 5.1's; collectable values carry BIT_ISCOLLECTABLE).
**
** Error protocol (no setjmp crosses the ABI): every rt_* returns a
** status. RT_ERR means an error value is staged (rt_err_copy) and the
** emitted code must early-return RT_ERR up its own frame chain; pcall
** boundaries call rt_err_clear.
**
** LUA_RT_ABI is versioned; bump on ANY change to signatures, semantics,
** or frozen constants. The backend refuses to emit against a mismatched
** runtime module.
